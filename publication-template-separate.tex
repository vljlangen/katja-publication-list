\section*{Editorial Work}

\subsection*{Sexual Medicine Textbook}
The first Finnish-language comprehensive textbook on Sexual Medicine (761 pages) was published by Duodecim Publishing Company Ltd in 2020, with myself serving as one of the four editors. In addition to editorial duties, which included reviewing chapters and providing guidance to other authors, I contributed nine chapters to the work. The book brought together 42 authors from various specialties in sexual medicine.

\medskip

The second edition, scheduled for 2024, will include eleven chapters of my authorship and is currently in preparation.

\subsection*{Theme Issues}
I served as editor, alongside Professor PÃ¤ivi Polo, for the special theme issue 'Impact of diseases on sexual health' in the Academic Journal Duodecim. My contributions included both an editorial and an article.

\medskip

Additionally, I have acted as Co-Editor for a Special Issue on Sexual Medicine in Maturitas.
